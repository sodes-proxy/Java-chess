# Java chess WIP

Repository containing a chess game made in java

## Why do a chess game in Java?

Wanted to practice my Object Oriented Programming skills, because I struggled with the paradigm when first introduced to it and that is something that I haven't corrected until now.

Currently I just have the basis and is a text game, my plans are to expand it and add graphics components using javafx, I also would like to implement a LAN way to play with other friend and lastly develop a basic AI for single sessions.

# Console Version

when starting the game you will be greeted with the following message:

![Console instructions](https://github.com/sodes-proxy/Java-chess/blob/master/images/instructions-Text-version.PNG)

Then the board will print and you will be asked to introduce the position of the piece you want to move:

![Piece selection](https://github.com/sodes-proxy/Java-chess/blob/master/images/select-piece.PNG)

A confirmation message will appear to let you know if the piece you selected is the one you intended to select:

If the position introduced is one that the piece cannot reach it will display the _illegal move_ message:

![Illegal move](https://github.com/sodes-proxy/Java-chess/blob/master/images/illegal-move.PNG)

When the position introduce the piece will move accordingly and the board will be updated:

![Correct move](https://github.com/sodes-proxy/Java-chess/blob/master/images/correct-move.PNG)
